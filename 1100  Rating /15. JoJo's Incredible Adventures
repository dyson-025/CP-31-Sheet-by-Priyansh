🎯 Goal

You are given a binary string s of length n.
Build an n × n table of cyclic right shifts of s.
Find the maximum rectangular area consisting of only 1s.

🧠 Key Observation (Your Code’s Core Idea)

You realized something brilliant:
👉 The actual n×n table does not need to be built!

Why?

Because every row is just a rotation of s.
So the table’s pattern of 1s is periodic — repeating cyclically both row-wise and column-wise.

Thus, instead of a 2D problem,
we can reduce it to 1D by focusing only on consecutive 1s in cyclic order.

🔍 Step 1: Handle the Cyclic Nature

In a cyclic string, consecutive 1s can wrap around the end → beginning.
So we can simulate this by checking s + s.

Example:

s = 1101
s+s = 11011101
Longest consecutive 1s = 3 (wraps around end)

🔢 Step 2: Find Longest Consecutive 1s (maxcons)

You looped through 2*n positions:

for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    if (s[i % n] == '1') cons++;
    else cons = 0;
    maxcons = max(maxcons, cons);
}


💡 Why modulo % n?
To “wrap” the string cyclically — mimicking s + s without extra memory.

Result → maxcons = length of the longest block of 1s (considering wrap-around).

🧩 Step 3: Handle Full 1s Case

If all characters are 1:

maxcons >= n


Then the entire matrix is filled with 1s.
→ The largest rectangle is the whole matrix.

✅ Area = n × n.

⚙️ Step 4: Partial 1s Case

When not all are 1s, you find the maximum rectangular area that can be formed diagonally due to cyclic shifting.

🔸 Why diagonal effect?

Each cyclic shift moves the block of 1s one step to the right,
so the rectangle can “extend” both horizontally and vertically — like a staircase.

To find the largest rectangle in that diagonal band of 1s:
You test all possible rectangle shapes formed by choosing a width and height within maxcons.

🔢 Step 5: Try All Possible Width × Height Combinations

You iterate for i = 1 to maxcons:

for (ll i = 1; i <= maxcons; i++) {
    ans = max(ans, i * (maxcons - i + 1));
}


Here:

i → possible height

(maxcons - i + 1) → possible width (remaining part of the consecutive block)

You’re effectively checking every possible rectangle dimension that can fit inside that maximum 1-block zone.

🧮 Step 6: Output Final Answer

If full 1s → output n * n
Otherwise → output the maximum area from the loop.

✅ Example Dry Run
Example: s = "011110"
n = 6
s+s = 011110011110
maxcons = 4 (four consecutive 1s)


Loop:

i	height	width	area
1	1	4	4
2	2	3	6
3	3	2	6
4	4	1	4

✅ Max area = 6
Matches sample output.

💡 Formula Derived from Loop

That loop effectively computes:

max area = max over i [ i × (maxcons - i + 1) ]

This can also be seen as the product of two parts of a rectangle diagonally aligned due to cyclic shifts.

🧾 Final Code (Your version, neatly formatted)
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        ll n = s.size();

        ll cons = 0, maxcons = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            if (s[i % n] == '1') {
                cons++;
                maxcons = max(maxcons, cons);
            } else {
                cons = 0;
            }
        }

        if (maxcons >= n) {
            cout << n * n << "\n";
        } else {
            ll ans = maxcons;
            for (ll i = 1; i <= maxcons; i++) {
                ans = max(ans, i * (maxcons - i + 1));
            }
            cout << ans << "\n";
        }
    }
}

🧮 Time Complexity

Finding longest 1s: O(2n)

Looping up to maxcons (≤ n): O(n)

Total per test: O(n)

Sum of n ≤ 2×10⁵ → ✅ efficient
